/**
 * ledcAttach — функция в API LED Control (LEDC) для Arduino-ESP32, которая настраивает 
 * вывод LEDC с заданной частотой и разрешением. Канал LEDC выбирается автоматически.
 * LEDC — периферийное устройство, которое в основном предназначено для управления яркостью 
 * светодиодов, но может также использоваться для генерации сигналов PWM для других целей.
 * 
 * Синтаксис:
 * bool ledcAttach(uint8_t pin, uint32_t freq, uint8_t resolution);
 * Аргументы:
 * pin — вывод LEDC;
 * freq — частота PWM;
 * resolution — разрешение для канала LEDC (диапазон — 1–14 бит, для ESP32 — 1–20 бит).
 *   Функция возвращает true, если конфигурация успешна. Если возвращается false, 
 * возникает ошибка, и канал LEDC не настроен:
 * - ошибка «ledcAttach was not declared in this scope» — возникает, если функция 
 * не объявлена в текущем контексте. В этом случае нужно убедиться, что в коде включена 
 * библиотека esp32-hal-ledc.h;
 * - ошибка «ledcAttachChannel(): вывод x уже подключён к LEDC» — может возникать, 
 * если вывод уже подключён к LEDC. В этом случае нужно проверить, не подключён ли вывод 
 * к другому каналу LEDC, и, если да, отсоединить вывод перед новым подключением.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
httpd_config_t — структура, которая содержит конфигурацию для HTTP-сервера, например, в контексте ESP32 HTTP Server. 

Поля:
unsigned task_priority    — приоритет задачи FreeRTOS, которая запускает сервер;
size_t stack_size         — максимальный размер стека, разрешённый для задачи сервера;
BaseType_t core_id        — ядро, на котором будет работать задача HTTP-сервера;
uint16_t server_port      — номер TCP-порта для приёма и передачи HTTP-трафика;
uint16_t ctrl_port        — номер UDP-порта для асинхронного обмена управляющими сигналами между различными компонентами сервера;
uint16_t max_open_sockets — максимальное количество сокетов/клиентов, подключённых в любое время (3 сокета зарезервированы для внутренней работы HTTP-сервера);
uint16_t max_uri_handlers — максимальное количество разрешённых обработчиков URI.

backlog_conn — параметр, который помогает справляться с кратковременными всплесками запросов, не теряя соединения. 

Чтобы изменить настройки структуры httpd_config_t, можно использовать функцию HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG 
для инициализации конфигурации по умолчанию, а затем модифицировать только те поля, 
которые конкретно определены в конкретном случае использования.

Назначение:
  Структура httpd_config_t используется в функции httpd_start — она создаёт экземпляр HTTP-сервера,
выделяет ему память и ресурсы в зависимости от заданной конфигурации, и выдаёт дескриптор экземпляру сервера.
  На сервере появляется прослушивающий сокет (TCP) для HTTP-трафика и управляющий сокет (UDP) 
для управляющих сигналов. Они выбираются циклически (по алгоритму round robin) в цикле задач 
сервера (server task loop).
  TCP-трафик обрабатывается как HTTP-запросы. В зависимости от запрошенного URI 
вызываются зарегистрированные пользователем обработчики, которые должны отправлять HTTP-пакеты ответов.

С помощью структуры можно настраивать, например: 
- приоритет задачи и размер её стека;
- очередь ожидающих соединений (параметр backlog_conn) — помогает справляться с кратковременными 
всплесками запросов, не теряя соединения;
- опцию сокета (например, enable_so_linger) — определяет поведение при закрытии TCP-сокета, 
когда в буфере остаются не переданные данные.

Обмен информацией по HTTP-протоколу происходит по следующей схеме:
- клиент формирует запрос на некоторый ресурс и отправляет его на сервер;
- сторона сервера принимает запрос. На этом этапе происходит его обработка;
- серверная сторона возвращает клиенту ресурс, который был запрошен изначально.
 
По умолчанию для коммуникации по HTTP используется порт 80, но может быть выбран 
и любой другой порт. Многое зависит от конфигурации конкретного веб-сервера
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
httpd_handle_t — структура, которая представляет указатель на экземпляр HTTP-сервера 
в реализации HTTP-сервера на платформе ESP-IDF. 
Структура возвращается функцией httpd_start() — как указатель на экземпляр сервера. 
Структура httpd_handle_t используется в API HTTP-сервера ESP-IDF для работы с 
экземпляром сервера. Например: 
- регистрация обработчиков URI. Каждый обработчик связан с конкретным URI и методом HTTP (GET, POST и т. д.). 
Функция-обработчик вызывается при получении запроса, соответствующего URI и методу;
- остановка сервера. Функция httpd_stop() останавливает сервер с предоставленным 
указателем и освобождает связанную память и ресурсы. При остановке задача закрывает 
все открытые соединения, удаляет зарегистрированные обработчики URI и сбрасывает 
данные контекста сеанса;
- получение контекста сеанса. Функция void *httpd_sess_get_ctx(httpd_handle_t handle, int sockfd) 
позволяет получить контекст сеанса из дескриптора сокета. Обычно контекст доступен 
обработчикам URI через структуру httpd_req_t, но в некоторых случаях функции 
отправки и получения данных сервера могут требовать контекста (например, для доступа к информации ключа).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
httpd_req_t — структура в контексте HTTP-сервера для ESP (ESP-IDF), которая содержит данные запроса. 
Она используется в контексте регистрации обработчиков URI в HTTP-сервере. Каждый 
обработчик URI связан с конкретным URI и методом HTTP (GET, POST и т. д.). Функция 
обработчика вызывается при получении запроса, соответствующего URI и методу. Функция 
обработчика должна возвращать значение типа esp_err_t. 
Также структура используется в API для чтения данных контента из HTTP-запроса — функция, 
которая читает данные из запроса в предоставленный буфер, использует поле content_len, 
чтобы знать длину данных, которые нужно получить. 
------------------------
httpd_uri_t — структура в контексте HTTP-сервера ESP-IDF, которая определяет, как 
сервер отвечает на запросы для конкретных URI и HTTP-методов. Она используется для 
регистрации обработчиков URI в HTTP-сервере.
